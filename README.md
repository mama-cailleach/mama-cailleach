## About Me

I’m about to start a BSc in Data Science because I’d love to mix my love for cricket with a career in data analysis (wicket nerds unite!). 
<br>Alongside my studies, I’m teaching myself to make wee games with Lua for the Playdate and Python for those classic CLI vibes I grew up with. 
<br>Lately, I’ve been building Python tools to make life (and code) a bit easier. I also put my experience in game localization and EN↔PTBR translation to work supporting indie games and devs.

Outside of tech: I’ve played in bands, worked as a sound engineer, and volunteered in DIY punk spaces. 
<br>I prefer they/them pronouns.
