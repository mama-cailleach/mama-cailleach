## About Me

I‚Äôm about to start a BSc in Data Science because I‚Äôd love to mix my love for cricket with a career in data analysis (wicket nerds unite!). Alongside my studies, I‚Äôm teaching myself to make wee games with Lua for the Playdate and Python for those classic CLI vibes I grew up with. 
Lately, I‚Äôve been building Python tools to make life (and code) a bit easier. I also put my experience in game localization and EN‚ÜîPTBR translation to work supporting indie games and devs.

Outside of tech, I‚Äôve played in bands, worked as a sound engineer, and volunteered in DIY punk spaces.  
I use they/them pronouns.

**Skills & Tools:**  
Python | Lua | Excel | SQL | Git | Playdate SDK | EN‚ÜîPTBR Translation/LQA
