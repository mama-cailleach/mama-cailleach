## About Me

Iâ€™m about to start a BSc in Data Science because Iâ€™d love to mix my love for cricket with a career in data analysis (wicket nerds unite!). Alongside my studies, Iâ€™m teaching myself to make wee games with Lua for the Playdate and Python for those classic CLI vibes I grew up with. 
Lately, Iâ€™ve been building Python tools to make life (and code) a bit easier. I also put my experience in game localization and ENâ†”PTBR translation to work supporting indie games and devs.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™ve played in bands, worked as a sound engineer, and volunteered in DIY punk spaces.  
I use they/them pronouns.

**Skills & Tools:**  
Python | Lua | SQL (basic) | Git | Playdate SDK | ENâ†”PTBR Translation/LQA
